## DATA STRUCTURES
####  1. Core Data Structures
#####  Arrays & Strings
- **Array insert/delete**: Understand time complexity – insertion/deletion at end is O(1) amortized, but at arbitrary position requires shifting elements (O(n)). For dynamic arrays (e.g., ArrayList), resizing doubles capacity, leading to amortized O(1). In interviews, handle edge cases like full array, empty slots, and maintaining order.
- **Array reversal**: In-place reversal using two pointers (start, end) swapping elements until they meet – O(n) time, O(1) space. Can be extended to reverse subarrays or rotate arrays.
- **2D arrays**: Row-major vs column-major traversal. Common problems: spiral traversal, matrix rotation, set matrix zeroes. Understand memory layout and cache efficiency (traverse in order of storage).
- **Pattern matching**: String algorithms (naïve, KMP, Rabin-Karp) for substring search. Know how to compute failure function in KMP, rolling hash in Rabin-Karp to avoid spurious hits.
- **Array rotation**: Reversal algorithm (reverse parts then whole) to rotate in O(n) time with O(1) space. Also consider juggling algorithm and block swaps. For left rotation by k, effective shift = k mod n.
- **Palindrome check**: Two-pointer technique from ends; skip non-alphanumeric characters if needed (e.g., valid palindrome). For substring palindromes, expand around center or use DP.
#####  Linked Lists
- **Singly linked list**: Node with value and next pointer. Operations: insert (head, tail, middle), delete (by value, by position). Need to handle head updates. Dummy node simplifies edge cases.
- **Doubly linked list**: Each node has prev and next pointers. Enables backward traversal and easier deletion of a given node. Used in LRU cache implementation.
- **Cycle detection**: Floyd’s cycle detection (tortoise and hare) – O(n) time, O(1) space. Also find start of cycle by resetting one pointer to head after detection.
- **List reversal**: Iterative (three pointers: prev, curr, next) or recursive. For singly linked, reverse entire list or reverse sublists (e.g., reverse between positions). For doubly, also swap prev/next.
- **Fast/slow pointers**: Technique for finding middle, detecting cycle, finding k-th from end. Slow moves one step, fast moves two. For middle, when fast reaches end, slow is at middle.
- **Merge lists**: Merge two sorted linked lists – iterative with dummy head. Also merge k sorted lists using priority queue (min-heap) or divide-and-conquer.
#####  Stacks & Queues
- **Stack implementation**: Using arrays (with top pointer) or linked list (push/pop at head). LIFO. Applications: function call stack, undo/redo, expression evaluation.
- **Queue implementation**: Using arrays (circular buffer) or linked list (head for dequeue, tail for enqueue). FIFO. Know circular queue to reuse space.
- **Parentheses matching**: Use stack to push opening brackets, pop on closing and check match. Also valid for multiple types. Edge cases: unmatched closing, empty stack.
- **Expression evaluation**: Infix to postfix (Shunting-yard algorithm), postfix evaluation using stack. Handle operator precedence and associativity.
- **Next greater element**: Monotonic stack (decreasing order) to find next greater for each element in array. O(n) time.
- **Circular queue**: Fixed-size array with front and rear pointers modulo size. Operations: enqueue (move rear), dequeue (move front). Check full/empty conditions carefully.
#####  Hashing & Heaps
- **HashMap / HashSet**: Underlying array of buckets, hash function, collision resolution (chaining vs open addressing). Load factor and rehashing. Java HashMap uses treeify after threshold. Know time complexities: average O(1), worst O(n).
- **Coding hash-based problems**: Two Sum using HashMap to store complements. Group anagrams by sorting string as key. Subarray sum equals k using prefix sum and map.
- **Min heap / Max heap**: Complete binary tree stored in array. For min-heap, parent <= children. Heapify: building heap in O(n). Insert and extract-min in O(log n). PriorityQueue in Java.
- **Priority queue**: Implemented via heap. Used in Dijkstra, Huffman coding, merging k sorted lists. Know comparator customizations.
- **Heapify operations**: Up-heap (percolate up) after insert, down-heap (heapify) after removal. Building heap from array uses bottom-up heapify (O(n)).
- **Heap sort**: Build max-heap, repeatedly extract max and place at end – O(n log n) in-place, not stable.
####  2. Trees
#####  Binary Trees
- **Tree traversals**:
  - **Preorder**: root-left-right; used for copying tree, prefix expression.
  - **Inorder**: left-root-right; gives sorted order in BST.
  - **Postorder**: left-right-root; used for deleting tree, postfix expression.
  - **Level order (BFS)**: using queue; prints tree level by level.
- **Tree height**: Recursive max(left, right) + 1. Edge case: empty tree height 0. Iterative BFS can also compute levels.
- **Tree diameter**: Longest path between any two nodes (may not pass through root). Compute height of left and right for each node, track max (left+right). O(n) with post-order.
- **Balanced tree check**: Height-balanced (difference <=1 for all nodes). Check recursively, early exit if unbalanced.
- **Mirror tree**: Swap left and right children recursively. Also check if two trees are mirrors.
- **Tree boundary**: Print boundary in anti-clockwise: root, left boundary (excluding leaves), leaves (inorder), right boundary (reverse order). Handle edge cases like single node.
- **Revert tree**: Invert binary tree (swap children). Same as mirror.
#####  Binary Search Tree
- **BST operations**: All operations average O(log n), worst O(n) if skewed.
- **Insert / Delete**: Insert as leaf based on comparisons. Delete: case 1 leaf, case 2 one child, case 3 two children (find inorder successor/predecessor, copy value, delete successor).
- **Search**: Compare key with root, go left or right. Recursive or iterative.
- **Inorder successor**: Minimum node in right subtree if exists, else nearest ancestor for which node is in left subtree.
- **BST validation**: Check if tree is valid BST. Use range (min, max) recursively. Or do inorder traversal and check if sorted.
- **Lowest common ancestor**: For BST, compare both nodes with root; if both smaller go left, both larger go right, else current is LCA.
- **Path to node**: Find path from root to node (backtracking or storing ancestors). Useful for LCA in binary tree.
#####  Advanced Trees
- **AVL trees**: Self-balancing BST with balance factor (-1,0,1). Rotations: LL, RR, LR, RL to maintain balance. Insert/delete O(log n) with rebalancing.
- **Segment tree**: For range queries and updates (e.g., sum, min). Build in O(n), query/update O(log n). Nodes store aggregate info for segments. Lazy propagation for range updates.
- **Fenwick tree (BIT)**: For prefix sums and point updates. Simpler than segment tree, but limited to invertible operations (sum, xor). Build O(n log n), query/update O(log n). Index based on least significant bit.
- **Trie**: Tree for strings, each node represents a character. Used for prefix search, auto-complete, spell checker. Insert/search O(L) where L is word length. Memory heavy, can compress.
- **Prefix search**: Given prefix, traverse trie to node, then collect all words (DFS). Alternatively store end-of-word flag.
- **Auto-complete**: Trie with suggestions based on prefix. Often combined with frequency or sorting.
####  3. Graph Algorithms

#####  Graph Basics
- **Adjacency list**: Array of lists for each vertex, space O(V+E). Preferred for sparse graphs. Easy to iterate neighbors.
- **Adjacency matrix**: 2D array of size VxV, space O(V^2). Fast edge check O(1). Suitable for dense graphs.
- **Graph representation**: Choose based on density and operations. For weighted graphs, store weight in list or matrix cell.
- **Directed graphs**: Edges have direction. In-degree and out-degree. Can have cycles.
- **Undirected graphs**: Edges bidirectional. Usually stored as two directed edges or single with both ends.
- **Weighted graphs**: Edges have weights. Represent as list of tuples (neighbor, weight) or matrix with weights.

#####  Traversal
- **Depth First Search**: Recursive or stack. Used for connectivity, cycle detection, topological sort. Time O(V+E). Mark visited to avoid revisits.
- **Breadth First Search**: Queue. Finds shortest path in unweighted graph. Also for level order, bipartite check.
- **Connected components**: Run DFS/BFS on unvisited nodes, each run gives a component. For directed, strongly connected components (Kosaraju/Tarjan).
- **Cycle detection**: Directed: use recursion stack or color array. Undirected: DFS with parent check.
- **Topological sort**: Only DAG. DFS with post-order or Kahn’s algorithm (BFS with indegree). Used for dependency resolution.
- **Strongly connected components**: Kosaraju (two DFS) or Tarjan (single DFS with low-link). Important for analyzing directed graphs.

#####  Shortest Path
- **Dijkstra**: Non-negative weights. Priority queue, O((V+E) log V). Greedy: always relax smallest distance. Not for negative edges.
- **Bellman-Ford**: Handles negative weights, detects negative cycles. Relax all edges V-1 times, O(VE). For each edge, if distance improves, negative cycle.
- **Floyd-Warshall**: All pairs shortest paths. DP over intermediate vertices, O(V^3). Works for negative edges but no negative cycles.
- **0–1 BFS**: For graphs with edge weights 0 or 1. Use deque: push front for 0, back for 1. O(V+E).

#####  Advanced Graph
- **Minimum spanning tree**: Prim (similar to Dijkstra) and Kruskal (sort edges, union-find). Both O(E log V). MST for undirected weighted graphs.
- **Union find**: Disjoint set with union by rank/size and path compression. Near constant time. Used in Kruskal, cycle detection in undirected graphs.
- **Bipartite graph check**: Graph 2-colorable. Use BFS/DFS and assign alternate colors. No odd cycle.
- **Graph coloring**: Assign colors to vertices such that adjacent have different colors. NP-hard for arbitrary colors; for bipartite, 2 colors suffice. Greedy coloring with ordering.

####  4. Recursion & Backtracking

#####  Recursion Basics
- **Base case / recursive case**: Essential to define termination condition to avoid infinite recursion. Base case handles smallest input.
- **Factorial**: Classic: n*factorial(n-1). Tail recursion optimization possible (but not in all languages).
- **Fibonacci**: Naive recursion has exponential time due to overlapping subproblems. Use memoization or iterative.
- **Tower of Hanoi**: Move n disks from source to destination using auxiliary. Recurrence: T(n)=2T(n-1)+1, steps 2^n-1.
- **Power calculation**: Recursive power (a^n) using divide and conquer: a^(n/2)*a^(n/2) for even, etc. O(log n).
- **Array recursion**: Problems like sum, max, reverse array using recursion with indices.
- **String recursion**: Palindrome check, permutations, subsequences.

#####  Combinatorics
- **Generate subsets**: For each element, include/exclude. Backtracking or bitmask. O(2^n). Subsets vs subsequences (order preserved).
- **Generate permutations**: Swap positions (Heap's algorithm) or use visited array. O(n!). Duplicates handling by sorting and skipping.
- **Phone letter mapping**: Map digits to letters, generate all combinations. Backtracking with index.
- **Generate parentheses**: Add open if count < n, close if close < open. Valid only if close <= open at any point.
- **Combination sum**: Find all combinations that sum to target, can reuse same element (with index to avoid order duplicates). Backtracking.

#####  Backtracking
- **N-Queens**: Place queens row by row, check column and diagonals. Backtrack when conflict. Use boolean arrays for columns and diagonals (row-col constant, row+col constant).
- **Sudoku solver**: Find empty cell, try digits 1-9, check row, column, box constraints. Recursively fill.
- **Word search**: DFS from each cell matching first char, mark visited, backtrack. Check boundaries.
- **Rat in maze**: Find path from top-left to bottom-right (can move right/down). Recursive with visited matrix.
- **Knight's tour**: Place knight on board, move to unvisited cells according to knight moves. Warnsdorff's heuristic for optimization.
- **Subset sum**: Check if subset with given sum exists. Backtracking with pruning.

#####  Optimization
- **Memoization**: Store results of subproblems to avoid recomputation (top-down DP). Use map or array. E.g., Fibonacci.
- **Pruning techniques**: In backtracking, cut branches early (e.g., in N-Queens, skip if conflict; in subset sum, if sum exceeds target). Order of choices can improve pruning (e.g., start with largest).

####  5. Searching & Sorting

#####  Searching
- **Linear search**: O(n). Simple but inefficient for large data. Used on unsorted data.
- **Binary search**: O(log n) on sorted array. Must handle integer overflow (mid = low + (high-low)/2). Variants: find first/last occurrence, floor/ceil.
- **Rotated array search**: Modified binary search: check which half is sorted and decide which side to go. Handles duplicates (may degrade to linear).
- **First / last occurrence**: Binary search with condition to move left or right. For first occurrence, if mid == target, move left; for last, move right.
- **Peak element**: Find any peak (element greater than neighbors). Binary search: if mid < mid+1, peak on right, else left. O(log n).
- **Square root (binary)**: Compute integer sqrt using binary search between 0 and x. For precision, use double.
- **2D matrix search**: If matrix rows and columns sorted, search from top-right or bottom-left (O(m+n)). If fully sorted (row-wise), treat as 1D array (binary search on index).
- **Search insert position**: Binary search to find position where target would be inserted (lower bound).

#####  Sorting
- **Bubble sort**: Repeatedly swap adjacent if out of order. O(n^2). Stable. Optimize by stopping if no swaps.
- **Selection sort**: Find minimum and swap to front. O(n^2). Not stable.
- **Insertion sort**: Build sorted portion by inserting each element. O(n^2) but efficient for small or nearly sorted data. Stable.
- **Merge sort**: Divide and conquer, O(n log n) time, O(n) space. Stable. Good for linked lists and external sorting.
- **Quick sort**: Pick pivot, partition, recurse. Average O(n log n), worst O(n^2) if poor pivot. In-place, not stable. Optimizations: random pivot, median-of-three.
- **Heap sort**: Build heap, extract max. O(n log n) in-place, not stable.
- **Counting sort**: O(n+k) where k is range. Stable if using cumulative counts. Only for integers with limited range.
- **Radix sort**: Sort by digits, using counting sort per digit. O(d*(n+k)) where d digits, k base. Good for fixed-length keys.
- **Bucket sort**: Distribute into buckets, sort each (e.g., insertion sort). O(n) average if uniform distribution.

#####  Two Pointer Techniques
- **Two sum / Three sum**: For sorted array, two pointers from ends. For three sum, fix one and use two pointers on remaining. Avoid duplicates by skipping.
- **Container with most water**: Two pointers at ends, move the pointer with smaller height, track max area. O(n).
- **Dutch flag algorithm**: Three-way partitioning (0,1,2). Use low, mid, high pointers. Move mid based on value.
- **Remove duplicates**: From sorted array, two pointers: one for read, one for write. O(n) in-place.

####  6. Greedy Algorithms
- **Activity selection**: Choose non-overlapping activities with max count. Sort by end time, pick if start >= last end. O(n log n).
- **Fractional knapsack**: Items with weight and value, maximize value with weight limit. Sort by value/weight, take fractions. O(n log n).
- **Job scheduling**: Minimize lateness or maximize profit. For scheduling with deadlines and profit (each job takes unit time), sort by profit and assign to latest free slot.
- **Huffman coding**: Build optimal prefix codes. Use min-heap, combine two smallest frequencies repeatedly. Greedy yields optimal compression.
- **Meeting rooms**: Minimum rooms needed. Sort by start and end times, use two pointers or min-heap to track earliest ending.
- **Merge intervals**: Sort by start, then merge overlapping. Output list of merged intervals.
- **Minimum platforms**: For train arrivals/departures, sort arrival and departure separately, two-pointer to find max platforms at any time.
- **Coin change (greedy)**: Works only for canonical coin systems (e.g., USD). Not always optimal; use DP for general.

####  7. Sliding Window
- **Fixed size window**: Sum of subarray of size k: compute first window, then slide by subtracting left, adding right.
- **Variable size window**: Expand right until condition met, then shrink left while condition holds. Used for subarrays with constraints.
- **Maximum sum subarray**: Kadane's algorithm is DP, not sliding window (unless fixed size). For fixed size, use sliding window sum.
- **Longest substring without repeating**: Use two pointers and hashset to track characters in current window. When duplicate, move left to after previous occurrence.
- **Minimum window substring**: Find smallest substring containing all characters of target. Expand right, when condition met, shrink left. Use hashmap to count characters.
- **K distinct characters**: Longest substring with at most K distinct. Use hashmap to count, shrink when >K.
- **Anagram count**: Count occurrences of anagrams of pattern in text. Use sliding window with frequency arrays.
- **Fruits in baskets**: Similar to at most two distinct characters (fruits). Variable window.

####  8. Monotonic Stack
- **Next greater element**: Maintain stack of indices with decreasing values. For each element, pop while smaller, record next greater for popped, push current.
- **Stock span problem**: Consecutive days price <= current. Monotonic stack storing pairs (price, span). Pop while top price <= current, accumulate span.
- **Largest rectangle in histogram**: For each bar, find left and right smaller indices. Use stack to compute next smaller left and right. Area = height * (right-left-1).
- **Sliding window maximum**: Maintain deque of indices with decreasing values. For each window, remove out-of-range front, remove from back smaller than new, add new. Front is max.

####  9. Dynamic Programming

#####  Fundamentals
- **Memoization**: Top-down DP, recursion with caching. Overlapping subproblems identified.
- **Tabulation**: Bottom-up DP, iterative filling table. Often more efficient (no recursion overhead).
- **Overlapping subproblems**: Subproblems recur many times, enabling DP (e.g., Fibonacci).

- **Edit distance**: Transform string1 to string2 with insert/delete/replace. dp[i][j] = min of three operations.
- **0/1 knapsack**: Maximize value with weight limit. dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], dp[i-1][w-weight[i]]+value[i]).

#####  Advanced DP
- **Matrix chain multiplication**: Minimum scalar multiplications. dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + dims[i-1]*dims[k]*dims[j]) over k.
- **Palindrome partitioning**: Minimum cuts to partition string into palindromes. Precompute palindrome table, then dp[i] = min(dp[j-1]+1) for j..i palindrome.
- **Word break**: Check if string can be segmented into dictionary words. dp[i] = true if dp[j] and s[j:i] in dict.
- **Bitmask DP**: State represented by bitmask (e.g., traveling salesman). dp[mask][last] = min cost.

####  10. String Algorithms

#####  Pattern Matching
- **Naive search**: O(n*m) worst-case. Simple but inefficient.
- **KMP algorithm**: Preprocess pattern to build LPS (longest prefix suffix) array, then search in O(n+m). Avoids backtracking in text.
- **Rabin-Karp**: Rolling hash (e.g., base 256 mod prime). Hash of pattern compared to text window. Hash collisions handled by verification. O(n+m) average.
- **Boyer-Moore**: Preprocess bad character and good suffix heuristics. Skips sections, sublinear on average. Complex to implement.
- **Z algorithm**: Computes Z-array (longest substring starting at i matching prefix). Used for pattern matching by concatenating pattern + "$" + text. O(n+m).
- **Aho-Corasick**: Build trie with failure links for multiple pattern matching. O(n + total matches). Used in antivirus, etc.

#####  String Operations
- **String rotation**: Check if s2 is rotation of s1 using s1+s1 contains s2 (if lengths equal). Also can find rotation point.
- **Anagram detection**: Two strings are anagrams if sorted equal or character counts equal.
- **Group anagrams**: Use sorted string as key in map, or character count tuple.
- **Longest common prefix**: Sort strings and compare first and last, or vertical scanning.

####  11. Bit Manipulation
- **Bitwise operations**: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >> (arithmetic vs logical shift in languages). Know precedence.
- **Bit masking**: Use masks to set, clear, toggle, check bits. E.g., set kth bit: num | (1<<k); clear: num & ~(1<<k).
- **Count set bits**: Brian Kernighan algorithm: while(n) { count++; n &= n-1; } O(number of set bits). Also built-in: Integer.bitCount().
- **Power of two**: Check if n>0 and (n & (n-1)) == 0.
- **Brian Kernighan algorithm**: As above, clears lowest set bit each iteration.
